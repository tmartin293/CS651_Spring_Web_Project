      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">What is Spring?</h1>
      <p>Spring is an open-source framework that provides infrastructure support for developing Java enterprise applications. It is considered as a <i>framework of frameworks</i> as it consists of a number of smaller frameworks like Spring MVC, Spring AOP, Spring ORM and Spring Web Flow.</p>
	  <p>It provides developers the flexibility to choose from a variety of sub-frameworks and modules that it supports, as per their requirement. Its ability to provide support for a wide range of application architectures like transactional data and persistence, messaging and web, makes it one of the most widely used frameworks in the industry.</p>
	  <p>Spring is considered lightweight as the framework and its dependencies are contained in just a few JAR files. It makes use of existing technologies such as ORM framework, jee, jdk timers and many view technologies. It follows a POJO development structure and supports mechanisms like dependency injection and aspect-oriented programming.</p>

	<div class="w3-rest w3-padding-32">
	<h1 class="w3-text-teal">What is Spring MVC?</h1>
      <p>Spring MVC is a part of comprehensive Spring framework that specifically supports web application development. It is based on Model-View-Controller architecture. It makes use of Spring's key features like dependency injection to enable easier, faster and smoother web application development.</p>

      </p> 
	  <p>The core container contains modules like Beans and Core, responsible for implementing features like dependency injection.</p>
	  <p>The Data access/ integration layer contains modules like ORM, responsible for providing integration support for object-relational mapping APIs like Hibernate.</p>
	  <p>AOP layer is responsible for implementing features like aspect-oriented programming using method-interceptors and pointcuts.</p>
	  <p>The Test module is responsible for providing support for testing different Spring components including, providing mock test objects.</p>
	  <p>The Web layer consists of modules and frameworks like Spring MVC and Spring WebFlux, responsible for implementing web-oriented integration features and supporting web application development.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Key features</h1>
      <br><h2 class="w3-text-teal">POJO structure</h2>
      <p>Spring supports application development from "Plain Old Java Object", commonly referred to as POJO development structure. A POJO class is used to define an object or an entity (for e.g. a database entity) that encompasses buisness logic. JavaBeans are also special type of POJOs.</p>
      
      <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Dependency Injection</h2>
      <p>Dependency injection provides the capability of separating the initialization of objects from the class which consumes those objects as dependencies. For example -</p>
	  <p>Consider a simple class Store, whose constructor requires an object of another class Item to initialize its object-&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>public class Store {</p>
	  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; private Item item;</p>
	  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; public Store(Item item) {</p>
	  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; this.item = item;</p>
	  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; }</p>
	  <p>}</p>
	  <p>This is an example of Dependency Injection where we have separated initialization of Item object from initialization of Store object. So, Store class has a dependency over Item class and this dependency is injected into Store object by calling class.&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>Spring core container modules provide support for dependency injection using XML configurations as well as using annotations like @Bean, @Configuration and @Autowired.</p>
	  <p>For example -&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>@Configuration</p>
	  <p>public class AppConfig {&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; @Bean</p>
	  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; public Item item1() {</p>
	  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return new ItemImpl1();</p>
	  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; }</p>
	  
	  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; @Bean</p>
	  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; public Store store() {</p>
	  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return new Store(item1());</p>
	  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; }</p>
	  <p>}</p>
	  <p>In this example, @Configuration on AppConfig class indicates that it contains beans, namely  item1 and store. This is an example of constructor-based Dependency Injection, where when constructor of Store class is invoked, a dependency is injected utilizing another bean (item1) since it is an argument for Store class constructor.</p>
