      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Advantages</h1>
      <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li><h2 class="w3-text-teal">Open source</h2></li>
  <p>Spring is an open-source framework and has great community support which is why it has been actively evolving for more than 15 years. The latest stable release (version 5.2.0) came out in September, 2019.</p>
  <li><h2 class="w3-text-teal">Support for existing technologies</h2></li>
  <p>Spring comes with templates for technologies like Hibernate, ORM frameworks, etc. which allow developers to write minimum code in order to develop applications, by using already existing code and technologies.</p>
  <li><h2 class="w3-text-teal">Lightweight</h2></li>
  <p>Spring implements POJO development structure, which is minimally invasive and developers do not need to implement any interface or inherit a class. It eliminates the need for an application server or a web server by providing a lightweight container.</p>
  <li><h2 class="w3-text-teal">Loose Coupling</h2></li>
  <p>Dependency injection and interface based programming helps develop loosely coupled Spring applications.</p>
  <li><h2 class="w3-text-teal">Easy to Test</h2></li>
  <p>The test data can be easily injected into application using JavaBean POJOs through Spring's dependency injection functionality.</p>
  <li><h2 class="w3-text-teal">Powerful abstraction</h2></li>
  <p>Spring provides an abstraction layer on technologies like JDBC, JTA and JMS that makes developing an application a lot smoother and faster.</p>
  <li><h2 class="w3-text-teal">Modular design</h2></li>
  <p>Spring MVC's design pattern provides a clean separation between controllers, JavaBean models and views making the development and testing of a web application a lot easier. Also, Spring MVC applications can easily be integrated with other components of Spring.</p>
  <li><h2 class="w3-text-teal">Flexibility</h2></li>
  <p>Spring MVC is based on interfaces rather than concrete inheritance like Struts, which makes it very flexible.</p>
  <li><h2 class="w3-text-teal">Scalability</h2></li>
  <p>Spring MVC web applications are highly scalable and can easily be scaled up to support large number of transactions.</p>
  <li><h2 class="w3-text-teal">Variety of View technologies</h2></li>
  <p>Spring MVC supports a variety of view technologies like JSP, Velocity and XLST. Developers can also create their own custom view mechanism by implementing Spring View interface.</p>
</ul><p></p>

    <div class="w3-rest w3-padding-32">
      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Limitations</h1>
      <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li><h2 class="w3-text-teal">Complex</h2></li>
  <p>Since Spring has been constantly developing, it has become very complex over the years. Also, the usage is changing constantly. From xml based configuration to annotation based config; spring has changed a lot lengthening the learning curve. </p>
  <li><h2 class="w3-text-teal">Difficult to learn</h2></li>
  <p>It is difficult to understand and learn, especially for a new programmer.It has grown a lot which makes it harder to start with. A new user of the spring has to go through a number of modules before deciding what should be used for their specific application. Of course a user can cherry pick the features, but it can be overwhelming when you are not aware of what each feature is. </p>
